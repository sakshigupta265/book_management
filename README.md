A [Spring Boot Application](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/) that uses [Hibernate](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/hibernate/index.htm), [JPA](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jpa/index.htm), [RESTful API's](https://restfulapi.net/) for data management. In this project the contents of a Database 'library' containing two tables 'book' and 'author' are managed.
